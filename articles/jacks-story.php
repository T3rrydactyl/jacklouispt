    <p>At the age of 16, an unfortunate incident occurred when I was returning home from a night out â€” I was subjected to an assault. This experience had a profound impact on my mental well-being, eroding my self-assurance to the point where even simple tasks like leaving the house became daunting. During this challenging period, a gym conveniently situated near my home came to my attention. Following my daily school routine, I would make my way there each evening. At that time, I didn't have a specific plan in mind; rather, the gym provided a sense of security and a safe place for me.<br><br>
Guided by a genuine desire for change, I embarked on my gym visits, navigating through the various machines without a clear understanding of their intended functions. Gradually, I started delving into research every night, uncovering insights about muscle growth and optimal training routines. As my efforts began to yield visible progress, a renewed sense of confidence blossomed within me. This positive shift in my self-perception culminated in a remarkable achievement: at the age of 18, I managed to match the Scottish bench press record.<br><br>
Today, at the age of 20, I stand proud of the physique I've sculpted and the wealth of knowledge I've acquired on this transformative journey. This transformation has been more than just physical; it has rekindled a level of confidence I never thought I could regain. Looking back, it's difficult to think where I might be now if not for the pivotal role the gym played in my life.
