# jacklouispt

Welcome to the repository for jacklouispt, a comprehensive digital platform for fitness enthusiasts. Initially launched in the summer of 2023, this initiative was co-directed by myself, [Jack Stoane](https://www.instagram.com/jackstoane/?hl=en-gb), and [Louis Benfield](https://www.instagram.com/louisbenfield_/), under the company name JACK LOUIS PT LIMITED. The full stack design and development of the site was carried out by myself, with Jack and Louis serving as the face of the company.

## About

jacklouispt aimed to provide personalised fitness and nutritional programmes tailored for a diverse user base seeking transformative results. The venture was concluded in 2024. The dissolution was due to strategic realignments, with the founders pursuing different career paths and the need for me to transition into a full-time role which affected my continued participation.

## Features

- Customised workout plans
- Nutritional guides and meal planning
- User progress tracking
- Responsive web design optimised for various devices
